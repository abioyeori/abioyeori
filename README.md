# Abioye Orimadegun ♦︎ IT Support ♦︎ Cybersecurity Analyst

Hey there! Welcome to my hub :)

I'm Abioye Orimadegun, an enthusiastic Cybersecurity Analyst (in Training). I'm constantly learning, tinkering, tweaking, and building a portfolio of projects on system administration and hardening, network management and security, threat detection and analysis.


## Cybersecurity Projects

Below you'll find a list of projects I'm working on to showcase my knowledge and skills in IT and information security. Each project is to demonstrate the use of a specific (or multiple) technology, tool, or application in real-world scenarios.

### Home Lab Setup
🔰 [Setting up a virtual home lab](https://github.com/abioyeori/home-lab-windows)
🔰 [Small-scale retail company setup with Active Directory](https://github.com/abioyeori/windows-server-domain-lab)

### Network Topology and Simulation
🔰 Setting up a SOHO network for testing


<!--
Home Lab Setup Documentation
Tools: VirtualBox, VMware, or Proxmox
What to do:
Set up a small home lab (e.g., a router, Windows Server, Linux client).
Configure DHCP, DNS, and firewall rules.
Write step-by-step documentation and explain what you learned.
Skills shown: Systems administration, network configuration, virtualization.

## Learning

I'm currently studying for CompTIA Security+ after completing CompTIA A+, Network+ and Google Professional Cybersecurity Certification training.  

I'm learning daily about how networks work and how to protect them from intrusion. I'm also actively learning about defensive security to enable me to effectively safeguard systems and respond to potential threats in real-world environments.

## Fun fact

I've been to one of the highest and coldest regions in Nigeria: Mambilla. And, I like taking landscape photos (I can send you some really cool ones as desktop wallpaper) 😜
